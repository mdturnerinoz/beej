# Beej Network Programming Projects for the Taking

The attached projects underneath this "beej" directory are original works from Brian "Beej" Hall's excellent book: "_Beej's Guide to Network Programming, Using Internet Sockets_" (2009 and later). 

I just figured that while I was creating makefiles and using git that I'd put his works at GitHub (allowed by the fact his book has put the code under a Creative Commons" license).

Feel free to use these in whatever way you wish.

PS I'll be adding sub-projects as I get them done (i.e. building and studying the code in his book's examples) and may even add some of my own once I get more "into" this.
